## JavaScript Algorithms
I have completed the basic, intermediate, and advanced algorithms in the past using JavaScript, but I deleted the old repositories because I enjoy the challenge and practice of doing them over and over.

In addition to solving the algorithms, I have included unit tests using **mocha**. [JetBrains Webstorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) integrates nicely with mocha, allowing one to easily run unit tests from the IDE.
